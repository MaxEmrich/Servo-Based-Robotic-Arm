# Servo-Based-Robotic-Arm

This is my repo for my Forwards and Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) solver.

## Usage

This program is designed for the Arduino IDE, running on the Arduino UNO Micro Controller.

## Implementation

This program is being implented in the Arduino IDE. I am currently working on a prototype for the Arduino IDE. For the actual arm, I am using 3d-printed joints and 9g Micro Servos. The arm will consist of 4 total joints: 1 base joint for rotation around the z-axis, and 3 other joints for rotating in the xy-plane.
